### Model 5 RL
this is a library for building multiple approaches using Reinforcement Learning with seq2seq , i have gathered their code to run in a jupiter notebook , and to access google drive 
built for python 2.7

### zaksum_eval.ipynb
built by python3 for evaluation

### Results/Pointer Generator
- output from Model 5 RL used as input to the zaksum_eval.ipynb
